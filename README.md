# Financial Phrasebank Sentiment Analysis
## Goal
Process text data and predict sentiment (positive, neutral, negative) in financial phrasebank using Natural Language Processing Techniques.

## Approach
- Used TF-IDF vectorization and logistic regression for sentiment classification.
- Preprocessed text with tokenization, stopword removal, and lemmatization; explored patterns with word clouds, sentiment distribution, and word count box plots.
- Evaluated models via confusion matrices, classification reports, and SHAP plots for interpretability.

## Key Results
- Best model: Unigram TF-IDF logistic regression with 83% accuracy.
- Positive sentiment recall improved with N-gram (1-5 word) model at the cost of precision.
- Found dataset bias toward neutral sentiment and influence of temporal terms.
